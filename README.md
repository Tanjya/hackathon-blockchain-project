# Healthcare Insurance deApp: A Secure and Scalable Solution

This repository houses the codebase for a novel healthcare insurance deApp built using a synergistic blend of technologies. Our team is dedicated to revolutionizing the healthcare insurance industry by leveraging the power of blockchain technology.

## Tech Stack

Front-End: ReactJS, Tailwind CSS
Back-End: NodeJS
Smart Contract Development:
Framework: PolkaDot
Deployment: Moonbeam (with potential for future parachain integration)
NFT Standard: ERC-721
## Core Functionality

This deApp offers a user-friendly platform for healthcare insurance management, facilitating secure and efficient transactions. Here's a glimpse into what it can achieve:

Policy Management: Users can register, manage, and view their healthcare insurance policies represented as NFTs.
Enhanced Security: Inherits robust security from the Polkadot network through Moonbeam's shared security model.
